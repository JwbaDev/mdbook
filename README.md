## About

Template a mdbook demo with [mdbook-theme](https://github.com/ghost717/mdbook-theme) and a yml file for github action automation and page publication.

Clone this repository and create md files in `src/` dir, then add the filenames in `SUMMARY.md`, and everything is ready to go.

But for the first time after pushing to github, set the source of github page to `gh-pages` branch and `/(root)` in `Settings`.

Have fun with mdbook!
